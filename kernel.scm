; Compatibility Layer
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The compatibility layer is composed of:
;
;   (readable-kernel-module-contents (exports ...) body ...)
;   - a macro that should package the given body as a module, or whatever your
;     scheme calls it (chicken eggs?), preferably with one of the following
;     names, in order of preference, depending on your Scheme's package naming
;     conventions/support
;       (readable kernel)
;       readable/kernel
;       readable-kernel
;       sweetimpl
;   - The first element after the module-contents name is a list of exported
;     procedures.  This module shall never export a macro or syntax, not even
;     in the future.
;   - If your Scheme requires module contents to be defined inside a top-level
;     module declaration (unlike Guile where module contents are declared as
;     top-level entities after the module declaration) then the other
;     procedures below should be defined inside the module context in order
;     to reduce user namespace pollution.
;
;   (my-peek-char port)
;   (my-read-char port)
;   - Performs I/O on a "port" object.
;   - The algorithm assumes that port objects have the following abilities:
;     * The port automatically keeps track of source location
;       information.  On R5RS there is no source location
;       information that can be attached to objects, so as a
;       fallback you can just ignore source location, which
;       will make debugging using sweet-expressions more
;       difficult.
;   - "port" or fake port objects are created by the make-read procedure
;     below.
;   
;   (make-read procedure)
;   - The given procedure accepts exactly 1 argument, a "fake port" that can
;     be passed to my-peek-char et al.
;   - make-read creates a new procedure that supports your Scheme's reader
;     interface.  Usually, this means making a new procedure that accepts
;     either 0 or 1 parameters, defaulting to (current-input-port).
;   - If your Scheme doesn't support unlimited lookahead, you should make
;     the fake port that supports 2-char lookahead at this point.
;   - If your Scheme doesn't keep track of source location information
;     automatically with the ports, you may again need to wrap it here.
;   - If your Scheme needs a particularly magical incantation to attach
;     source information to objects, then you might need to use a weak-key
;     table in the attach-sourceinfo procedure below and then use that
;     weak-key table to perform the magical incantation.
;
;   (invoke-read read port)
;   - Accepts a read procedure, which is a (most likely built-in) procedure
;     that requires a *real* port, not a fake one.
;   - Should unwrap the fake port to a real port, then invoke the given
;     read procedure on the actual real port.
;
;   (get-sourceinfo port)
;   - Given a fake port, constructs some object (which the algorithm treats
;     as opaque) to represent the source information at the point that the
;     port is currently in.
;
;   (attach-sourceinfo pos obj)
;   - Attaches the source information pos, as constructed by get-sourceinfo,
;     to the given obj.
;   - obj can be any valid Scheme object.  If your Scheme can only track
;     source location for a subset of Scheme object types, then this procedure
;     should handle it gracefully.
;   - Returns an object with the source information attached - this can be
;     the same object, or a different object that should look-and-feel the
;     same as the passed-in object.
;   - If source information cannot be attached anyway (your Scheme doesn't
;     support attaching source information to objects), just return the
;     given object.
;
;   (replace-read-with f)
;   - Replaces your Scheme's current reader.
;   - Replace 'read and 'get-datum at the minimum.  If your Scheme
;     needs any kind of involved magic to handle load and loading
;     modules correctly, do it here.
;
;   (parse-hash no-indent-read char fake-port)
;   - a procedure that is invoked when an unrecognized, non-R5RS hash
;     character combination is encountered in the input port.
;   - this procedure is passed a "fake port", as wrapped by the
;     make-read procedure above.  You should probably use my-read-char
;     and my-peek-char in it, or at least unwrap the port (since
;     make-read does the wrapping, and you wrote make-read, we assume
;     you know how to unwrap the port).
;   - if your procedure needs to parse a datum, invoke
;     (no-indent-read fake-port).  Do NOT use any other read procedure.  The
;     no-indent-read procedure accepts exactly one parameter - the fake port
;     this procedure was passed in.
;     - no-indent-read is either a version of curly-infix-read, or a version
;       of neoteric-read; this specal version accepts only a fake port.
;       It is never a version of sweet-read.  You don't normally want to
;       call sweet-read, because sweet-read presumes that it's starting
;       at the beginning of the line, with indentation processing still
;       active.  There's no reason either must be true when processing "#".
;   - At the start of this procedure, both the # and the character
;     after it have been read in.
;   - The procedure returns one of the following:
;       #f  - the hash-character combination is invalid/not supported.
;       ()  - the hash-character combination introduced a comment;
;             at the return of this procedure with this value, the
;             comment has been removed from the input port.
;       (a) - the datum read in is the value a
;
;   hash-pipe-comment-nests?
;   - a Boolean value that specifies whether #|...|# comments
;     should nest.
;
;   my-string-foldcase
;   - a procedure to perform case-folding to lowercase, as mandated
;     by Unicode.  If your implementation doesn't have Unicode, define
;     this to be string-downcase.  Some implementations may also
;     interpret "string-downcase" as foldcase anyway.

; the rest of the compatibility checks, unfortunately.  Sigh.

; Scheme Reader re-implementation
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; We have to re-implement our own Scheme reader.
; This takes more code than it would otherwise because many
; Scheme readers will not consider [, ], {, and } as delimiters
; (they are not required delimiters in R5RS and R6RS).
; Thus, we cannot call down to the underlying reader to implement reading
; many types of values such as symbols.
; If your Scheme's "read" also considers [, ], {, and } as
; delimiters (and thus are not consumed when reading symbols, numbers, etc.),
; then underlying-read could be much simpler.
; We WILL call default-scheme-read on string reading (the ending delimiter
; is ", so that is no problem) - this lets us use the implementation's
; string extensions if any.

  ; Identifying the list of delimiter characters is harder than you'd think.
  ; This list is based on R6RS section 4.2.1, while adding [] and {},
  ; but removing "#" from the delimiter set.
  ; NOTE: R6RS has "#" has a delimiter.  However, R5RS does not, and
  ; R7RS probably will not - http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/wiki/WG1Ballot3Results
  ; shows a strong vote AGAINST "#" being a delimiter.
  ; Having the "#" as a delimiter means that you cannot have "#" embedded
  ; in a symbol name, which hurts backwards compatibility, and it also
  ; breaks implementations like Chicken (has many such identifiers) and
  ; Gambit (which uses this as a namespace separator).
  ; Thus, this list does NOT have "#" as a delimiter, contravening R6RS
  ; (but consistent with R5RS, probably R7RS, and several implementations).
  ; Also - R7RS draft 6 has "|" as delimiter, but we currently don't.
